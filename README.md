Swin-MaskGNet is a grasping detection model specifically designed for dense occlusion and cluttered scenes.

The model uses Mask-RCNN as the overall framework, Swin transformer as the backbone feature extraction network, and modifies its head to add a grasping detection branch to achieve grasping detection in dense occlusion and cluttered scenes.

network_files include network structure, loss function, dataset processing, etc.
